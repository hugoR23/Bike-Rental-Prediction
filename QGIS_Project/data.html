The LED Partnership defines a job as a link between a worker and a firm at which the worker has been employed during the reference quarter and during the quarter prior to the reference quarter. The reference quarter is Quarter 2 (April-June) of the year of interest. This definition of "job" is sometimes called a "Beginning of Quarter" job because it is assumed that the worker was employed at that firm on the first day of the reference quarter.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Blocks were aggregated to census tracts and density was calculated by dividing the number of jobs in a census tract by the area in square miles.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold;">Field Definitions</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Tract2010: 2010 census tract ID numbers</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Pop2010: Population based on the 2010 US Census</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Area_smi: Area of the census tract in square miles</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Jobs_cnt: Number of jobs</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Jobs_psmi: Jobs per square mile</SPAN></P><P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold;">Source</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>US Census Bureau, 2009 Longitudinal Employerâ€“Household Dynamics (LEHD) Survey, http://lehd.did.census.gov/led/</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

Per capita income is calculated by summing all of the income within a census tract and dividing it by the number of residents. Median household income is calculated by determining the collective income of each household in a census tract and then determining the median household income for that census tract. Data are presented at the 2000 census tract level.
